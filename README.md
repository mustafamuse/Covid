## About
`Covid-19 Coronavirus Live Data Tracker `

Covid, is a React web app that was designed and engineered:

to chart all the global data for the recovered, infected and mortality rates of citizens worldwide.

I created this app utilizing the Covid-19 API and ChartsJS with the implementation of React hooks such as: 
UseEffect and UseState, to create both Line and Bar Charts.
